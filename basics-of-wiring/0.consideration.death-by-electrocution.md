# Death by Electrocution

Electricity is capable of killing you

### TL:DR;


Any voltage can be lethal depending on your conductivity. [source-double-check]

0.1 Amps is enough to kill you. [source][double-check]

Most of the time, 36V+ is when the voltage begins to be dangerous [source-double-check]

Current is what kills you [source][double-check]

### Why This Occurs

0. current can flow through your body
1. current is dependent on voltage and resistance
2. current affects your body through X
3. too much X and it will kill you

Current is what kills you [source;or-is-it-power?] - 0.1 Amps is enough to kill you.


### Examples

[todo] chart of voltage + handling combinations that can kill you

### Limits

[todo] when is it not deadly, when does it become deadly

### Contrasts

- it is similar to how wires can pass enough current through them to melt them
- we are lucky we have high enough resistance, considering we are made of water
