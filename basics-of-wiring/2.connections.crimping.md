# crimping

Crimping is commonly used to make secure connections between connectors and wires. A good crimping will produce a "cold weld" - which is both gas tight and mechanically secure.

# theory

Crimping applies a high pressure to produce cold welds between two metals.

Cold welding is a practice that welds metals together by overcoming the oxide layer and joining the materials through pressure. Cold welding in ideal situations can cause welds that are as strong as the parent metal itself.

Crimping is an efficient way to achieve cold welding.[1](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/482867) [2](https://temcoindustrial.com/product-guides/tools/crimping-tool-selection-guide)

### check for a good crimp

##### too loose
If the crimp is loose and "under crimped" the connector will not make a tight bond with the wire. This will result in a connection which is _not_ gas tight and _not_ mechanically secure, leading to failure due to [corrosion and wear](#what-is-needed). [3](http://www.lodanelectronics.com/articles/what-happens-during-the-wire-crimping-process/)

You can check if it is too loose by pulling on it. It should not budge, even if you pull on it hard. [todo:better-way-to-check]

##### too tight

If the crimp is too tight, it is not mechanically secure either - and will lead to failure due to [wear](#what-is-needed). [3](http://www.lodanelectronics.com/articles/what-happens-during-the-wire-crimping-process/). Similar to "over-torquing" a screw or bolt, you are breaking the metal instead of just deforming it.
