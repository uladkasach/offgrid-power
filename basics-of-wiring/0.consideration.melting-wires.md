# Melting Wires
The critical consideration in wiring circuits is the fact that too much current will melt your circuit and can cause a fire.

### TL:DR;

Metal has a low enough internal resistance that it will melt before you reach its capacity to carry current, in most voltages.

### Why This Occurs

1. current passing through a wire will produce heat
  - this is attributed to the internal resistance of the wire [source][is-this-true]?
  - this is physically caused by electrons bumping into other atoms in the wire, transferring their kinetic energy into the atom and making them vibrate [https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/67644/42618]
    - the vibration of atoms is is measured as heat [source]
  - the amount of current => the amount of movement => the amount of heat generated

2. current capable of passing through a wire is limited by resistance and voltage
  - I = V / R
    - the higher the voltage, the more current will go through it
    - the lower the resistance, the more current will go through it
  - which means
    - lower voltage circuits will be able to push less current through the same wire
    - higher resistance circuits will be able to push less current with the same voltage

3. metals have such low resistance that the current capable of passing them can melt them
  - metals have such a low resistance that they are capable of driving amounts of current that will melt them at most voltages
  - therefore, metals need protected externally, to limit the current that passes through them

### Examples

[todo] Show examples of melting wires with current passing through it

### Limits

[todo] What are the lower limits of voltages that can push enough current to melt a wire?

### Contrasts

[todo] Show examples of how other materials simply have too high of a resistance to pass hurtful current through
- wood
- glass
- plastic
- skin


[todo] Show how there is no safe voltage with which wires can be used without having a way to limit current
- even very low voltages cause massive current
