# Sizing Wires

Metal connectors melt if you put too much current through them [(see why)](0.consideration.melting-wires.md).
- Therefore, for safety, you must be sure that your wire is capable of handling the current you intend to pass through it. (Note: You must also be sure that your circuit will protect your wires for any current you _did not_ intend to pass through it with [fuses and breakers](fuses-and-breakers.md))

Metal conductors cause a voltage drop proportional to their length [(see why)][0.consideration.voltage-drop.md]
- Therefore, for efficiency, you must be sure that your wire is thick enough to efficiently conduct the current you intend to pass through it.

# theory

### consideration 1: safety under load

You want to make sure that the wire can safely conduct the current you need through it.
  - i.e., `safe-gauge = f(circuit-amps)`

This is because
- [metal conductors will allow enough current to pass through them to melt them](0.consideration.melting-wires.md)
- the amount of current metal conductors can handle safely is [dependent on the surface area of the conductors cross-section](../0.fundamentals-of-electricity/resistance-of-conductors.md)

### consideration 2: efficiency

In addition to [making sure that the wire will not melt and cause a fire](#consideration-1-safety-under-load),

You want to make sure that the wire can efficiently conduct the current along the full length of the circuit.
  - i.e., `efficient-gauge = f(circuit-amps, circuit-length)`

This is because:
- metal conductors produce a [voltage drop proportional resistance](0.consideration.voltage-drop.md)
- resistance of a conductor increases with the length of the conductor
- this voltage drop means energy wasted in the transmission of power

# practice

### gauge
Wire sizing has been standardized to two standards across the globe:

- American Wire Gauge (AWG)
  - standard in north america
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_wire_gauge

- International Electricians Commission (IEC 60228)
  - standard in most of the world
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_60228

You can readily find wires sold in these different sizes.

### sizing for safety

Ampacity is the maximum current that a conductor can carry continuously under the conditions of use without exceeding its temperature rating. The safe ampacity per gauge of wire has been defined by the National Electric Code, described in the table below.

##### quick reference table for safety

This table defines the minimum safe gauge for common amp loads, in AWG, as defined by the National Electric code.

- 15 amp => 14 gauge
- 20 amp => 12 gauge
- 30 amp => 10 gauge
- 40 amp => 8 gauge
- 50 amp => 6 gauge
- 70 amp => 4 gauge
- 100 amp => 1 gauge
- 200 amp => 250 kcmil
- 300 amp => 500 kcmil
- 400 amp => 750 kcmil

### sizing for efficiency

Although a conductor can safely carry a particular current continuously, depending on the length of the conductor, this can come with significant losses of efficiency. The ampacity of a wire is simply the minimum safe current that can be passed through it; to have an efficient circuit, you must consider the voltage drop that occurs over large lengths of wire.

Voltage drop can be significant enough that loads which are sensitive to the voltage they receive will no longer operate, so it is important to think through carefully.

Voltage drop increases across a conductor in proportion to the length of the conductor. This voltage drop can be mitigated by increasing the diameter of the wire.

##### quick reference table for efficiency

This table defines the minimum required gauge for common amp loads, for a 3% or less voltage drop over 15 feet (and 20 feet), in AWG.

- 10 amp => 12 gauge (10 gauge)
- 20 amp => 10 gauge (8 gauge)
- 30 amp => 8 gauge (6 gauge)
- 40 amp => 6 gauge (6 gauge)
- 50 amp => 6 gauge (4 gauge)
- 70 amp => 4 gauge (2 gauge)
