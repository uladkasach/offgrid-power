# Heat Shrink

Heat shrink is a good way add mechanical and electrical isolation to a connection between two conductors. Electrical insulation is achieved by the insulating property of the plastic material that is used in heat shrink. Mechanical insulation is achieved by the physical rigidity of the heat-shrink once it is "shrunk"
