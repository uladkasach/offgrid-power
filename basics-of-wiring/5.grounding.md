> The purpose for this ground is safety. A simple appliance might have a metal enclosure, which is connected to ground. Hot and neutral enter the appliance to power it. If something were to go wrong, like a wire came loose inside, if the chassis were not grounded, touching it could result in an electric shock. Having the chassis grounded instead diverts current back to Earth ground, usually in a very abrupt manner, such that the circuit breaker trips and power is cut off.
- https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/116154/59733

so, grounding an appliance ensures that the applicance is not "hot" - it makes sure that if it becomes hot, it would cause a short circuit that would flip a breaker and make it safe again
  - hence all ac appliances have a ground

  - this is safer, because otherwise the appliance would try to ground itself through you
    - [question]: why does electricity complete a circuit with the ground?


> What Happens if I Don’t Have Adequate Ground?
> The earth absorbs extra electrical current safely, eliminating the threat of dangerous paths to ground. What are those other paths? If your outlets and electrical box are not properly grounded, appliances and electronics you are using could end up passing excess current through you, using your body as a means to complete the path to the negatively charged ground. In other words, you could be shocked or electrocuted.

  - this source implies that the ground is negatively charged - so current will always flow to it...
    - but there isn't a circuit in that case, right?

  - > The ground wire in an electric outlet is a safety valve; any undesired electricity (positively charged energy) flows to the negatively charged ground, where it wants to go.

a better answer:
> A "ground" is any source or sink of electric charge which can supply or absorb so much charge that compared to the rest of the system, to a good approximation, it is an infinite source or sink of charge. The literal earth is the prime example of a ground, but it is not the only one. A satellite can't be connected to the literal ground, but it operates just fine because it can be connected to the object that is part of the satellite, such as the frame, which acts like a ground.
  - [7] https://www.quora.com/Why-does-electricity-want-to-earth
  - meaning, a ground is anything that can absorb _all_ charge

  - > Since most large machines have a metal frame providing structural support, and since large chunks of metal are huge sources of free charge, large machines are usually grounded to their frame.
    - this implies that its not even related to having a circuit - just related to having free charge available... no circuit required?

  - > Some people state that electricity always flows in a circuit, or always flow toward ground. These statements are oversimplified to the point of sometimes being wrong.
    - ok, that explains why those two seem like a contradiction

  - > The more accurate, fundamental statement is "free low-energy positive electric charge always flows toward lower electric potential (i.e. lower voltage)." It does this because a potential difference represents an electric field, and an electric field always exerts forces on positive electric charges in the direction toward lower voltage. If the charge is free, it will accelerate in response to this force and get moving toward the lower voltage
    - ok, this makes sense:
      - i.e., electrons move towards positive potential, regardless of how the potential is created
    - questions though:
      - why then is a circuit required? and
        - imagine no circuit - how would electron move?
          - would it be pushing the other electrons out of the way?
          - or, if it is positively charged, does it mean that there is already an insufficient amount of electrons in the circuit?
      - does this still apply in the contexts of batteries?
        - i.e., could electrons flow out of a battery - even if its not connected to negative?


Main question:
- how can current flow to "ground" without making a full circuit with its source?

Woah:
 >  current does not need a closed circuit to flow (like with a capacitor)
  - https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/148675/when-does-and-when-doesnt-current-flow-to-ground

> With only one connection to ground there is no circuit for the current to flow through. It can't flow "to" ground, because there is nowhere for it to flow to. There's no difference between ground and a wire dangling in the breeze.
  - https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/148684/59733
  - ok cool. yeah, in _all_  cases we _need_ a complete circuit - and the ground is just used as a conductor.

> Electricity flowing to ground in high voltage systems has nothing to do with the fact that they're high voltage. It's purely to do with there being a second connection to ground elsewhere in the circuit (usually at the sub-station) which forms the circuit.

--

Which could potentially pose a big problem in the context of an RV.

So, the facts are:
- ground is used as a conductor, to complete a circuit
  - question: what is the resistance of the ground? why is it used as a conductor?
  - note: "ground" depends on the context, but often is referred to as the "Earth/Dirt" in home settings... does that only apply at high voltage?
- ground _only_ works if there are two points connected to the ground, to complete the circuit
- grounding provides safety by short circuiting malfunctioning, "hot shell", appliances


So, questions:
- why is the dirt not a conductor in normal cases, but a conductor for grounding?
  - what is the resistance of the earth?
  - is there some sort of catch?
- why would an appliance falling in a tub of water electrocute you?
  - wouldn't it just short circuit itself?
- why would sticking a fork in a socket electrocute you?
  - wouldn't there be no circuit to complete?

So, concerns:
- if the shell of the van is hot (due to grounding) and we're connected to shore power, will that complete that circuit still?
  - or will it be possible that by stepping out of the van, _we_ become the ground?
  - NOTE: it is impossible to avoid becoming the ground when connected to shore power without grounding - but how is it possible to short circuit/trip our breaker with grounding?

- lets say ideal world:
  - ac power is grounded to chassis
    - which means:
      - we complete a circuit any time:
        - positive -> neutral
        - positive -> chassis (solves the hot vehicle shell problem; short-circuit)
        - positive -> ground (solves the hot appliance shell problem; short-circuit)
    - the ideal world being:
      - the vehicle is grounded to the ground through the inverter/charger-bypass, when connected to shore (!)
        - (?) - is this actually done by the multiplus?
      - the vehicle is grounded just through the chassis, when not connected to shore
        - (!?) - since there is no circuit between the inverter and the earth ground, this would never cause hot car shell -> ground problem, right?

  - dc power is grounded to chasis:
    - which means:
      - we complete a circuit any time:
        - positive -> neutral
        - positive -> chassis (solves the hot vehicle shell problem; short-circuit)

but this ideal world leaves the question:
  - can we really have a shared ground between AC and DC?
    - we can right, because the chassis is simply used as a conductor - and the electrons will not flow unless there is a circuit that allows them to flow?
  - question:
    - are there _any_ cases where electrons can flow without a completed circuit?

  - > It doesn't mean its resistance is high, it's actually surprisingly small.

- [use-case] ground is used as a "reference-point" of zero potential
  - > A ground is a reference point. You could litterally take any net in your circuit which is supposed to stay at a steady voltage and call it ground. After all voltage sources create a difference of potential (called a voltage) between two nets, regardless of what their potentials are - if they're both fixed externally, there will be a conflict and bad things, but if one of them is fixed the other potential will change accordingly. Generally the ground is taken such that we work with positive supplies predominantly, e.g. ground on the - terminal of a rectifier bridge. It doesn't mean all the current flow through that, it's only a reference.

- [use-case] it is also used as a "equi-potential-reference-point"
  - > The Earth is used for an equi[reference]potential supply
  - to make sure that every circuit in a power grid is relative to the same "zero"
    - otherwise, even if there is only 5v between pos and neg of the two circuits, relative to eachother, there could be 500! or more! (since there is nothing binding them to eachother)
  - [IMPORTANT!]: this means its _really_ important that all electrical circuits in a system have the same ground (i.e., same "zero" potential)
    - question: _how_ does connecting to a ground stabilize the potential?

- > The Earth has mainly a person protection role
  - because it allows a circuit to be completed immediately, if something goes wrong in the circuit, before a human touches it
    - (because the power supply is already grounded. had the power supply not been grounded, this would not be a factor[?] - until they touch a negative wire)
  - [IMPORTANT!]: this is helpful only if:
    - there is more amps flowing through that short than the normal breaker allows
    - you have a GFCI breaker as the main breaker -> and it notices the potential leak
      - [IMPORTANT]: get a GFCI breaker as your main breaker

  - > All exposed metal should be "grounded" by connecting it to a properly designed low impedance ground circuit in order to ...
  - > - Stop fault energy flowing into YOU or to other unintended places. The grounded metal will provide a much lower impedance than you will. Earth potential rise should be lower to much than phase voltage and you should at worst feel a reduced shock for a very short period.
  - > - Assist fault detection & interuption equipment to work properly (or at all). [eg fuses, circuit breakers, ground fault interrupters/earth leak circuit breakers etc.] A large amount of current, greatly in excess of the usual design maximum, will glow from "phase" to ground and cause the fuse or circuit breaker to interrupt the voltage.

important distiction "ground" -vs- "neutral"
  - https://forum.allaboutcircuits.com/threads/ac-and-dc-ground.38095/
    > It's important to not confuse "earth ground" with "neutral".
    > Neutral is the power return for AC.
    > Earth ground is protective; connected to the chassis/enclosure.
    > Neutral carries all of the return current that the "hot" line/lines supply.
    > Earth ground should carry no current at all.
    > In the States (USA), the earth Ground bus is connected to the Neutral bus inside the electrical service panel for safety purposes. This is the ONLY place in the system that they are connected together. After the wiring exits the service panel, Neutral and Ground are separate; any current above a few mA on Ground is considered an electrical fault.
    > This is somewhat confusing, because in most schematics you see posted here, the ground is used as a power return. In simple electronic schematics, ground is used as the 0v reference point. In most cases, it is also connected to earth ground. However, the earth ground does not carry any current; but it does establish the 0v reference point.
  - summary of above
    - "ground" is a safety mechanism, always
    - "neutral" is the return path of the circuit, always
    - in AC circuits:
      - "ground" is only bonded in the distribution panel - so that the breaker can detect the fault and trip the breaker
      - "ground" is always distinct and separate from neutral outside of that one place in the distribution panel
    - in DC circuits:
      - "ground" is used to set a 0v reference point, by binding it to neutral
      - "ground" is used here as well to detect the fault and break the fuse


[11] https://www.quora.com/In-AC-generation-there-are-no-positive-and-negative-polarities-as-in-DC-What-does-neutral-in-AC-circuits-mean-How-is-it-safe-to-touch-the-neutral-and-not-the-phase
- > By fixing the neutral wire very close to the potential of the earth, the hot wire is now forced to alternate between about +120 V and -120 V relative to not only the neutral wire, but also to the earth. This is what makes this wire “hot”.


Note:
- fixing the "neutral" to the "ground" does two things:
  - fixes the potential of the positive relative to the earth (i.e., difference between positive and earth is now +/-120VAC / 24VDC - instead of _anything_)
- creates a saftey circuit which allows all grounded appliances to complete a circuit and trip breakers in faults
  - avoiding you becoming this conductor accidentally
  - which also is critical because the AC power supply is always grounded already - so if your circuit / appliance is not grounded - you'll be used

Main question is:
- can AC and DC share a common ground? (i.e., can we bond the neutrals - since at the end of the day, neutrals bond to ground)
- in a DC to AC inverter - how should you ground?

---

Can AC and DC share common ground?

and more so:

How to ground a DC to AC inverter?:
- https://www.bluesea.com/support/articles/DC_and_AC_Circuit_Wiring/101/Grounding_and_Circuit_Protection_for_Inverters_and_Battery_Chargers
  - > Take additional steps to assure that there is proper grounding between AC and DC.
  - > The AC grounding system and the DC grounding system should be firmly connected at a main grounding bus or at the engine block


> A-20 and A-25 contain specific installation directions that are not described in E-11.
  - > - 2. Install the AC wiring to the charger or inverter including an AC grounding conductor of a size equal to the current carrying conductors unless the circuit exceeds 30A, in which case the grounding conductor may be one size smaller (E11.16.1.3.8.2). This is the typical grounding conductor that you would see with any AC appliance and returns with the other AC conductors to the power distribution panel.
  - > - 3. Install a DC grounding conductor sized not less than one size smaller than the DC positive conductor and have a capacity such that the DC positive fuse has an amperage rating not greater than 135% of the current rating of this grounding wire. As a practical matter, this wire will be much larger than the AC grounding conductor. This requirement is the latest addition to the standards when it was discovered that faults in the DC side of an inverter or charger could provide sustained high currents that could start a fire from overheating the AC grounding conductor.


The above says:
  1. AC and DC must be grounded together (i.e., neutrals must be shared)
     1. this implies that it is ok to bind the neutrals together
     2. TODO: confirm this
  2. Install wiring including an AC grounding conductor (multiplus gives us a place to put it)
  3. Install a DC grounding conductor (assuming to the body)


Reasoning of making the grounding wire from the charger/inverter DC rated:
  - [tldr] dc faults would have taken the AC rated wire - which is much smaller - and caused a fire
  - > It was then determined that a fire hazard exists when a DC fault in a charger or inverter can pass DC current into the AC safety ground wire. The AC safety ground was not sized for the high DC currents, so a high capacity DC grounding wire is now required by standards A-20 and A-25.

SO:
- what does the multiplus expect of us?

Main question:
- do we ground the distribution panel to chassis?
  - we _should_ since otherwise when connected to shore power, if the chassis is hot due to a short, we'd be the conductor between it and ground
  - but does the multiplus say not to? i feel like that was a thing

to read: https://community.victronenergy.com/questions/21965/rcd-grounding-multiplus-grounding-negative.html
  - > Only bond the battery negative to ground at one point
    - [question]: why?
      - implies the same reason as why neutral is only bonded to ground in one place, in distribution panel, in ac system too 🤔

  - > You must only have ONE AC neutral-earth bond/link active at any one time and it must be located before (not after) an RCD for it to operate correctly (for all return current to pass through the neutral cable and balance with the current in the active cable - unless an earth leakage fault occurs)
    - [requirement] .... this means that for it to detect a fault, the ground should be linked to neutral _before_ it reaches the GFCI?
      - because only then would the ground not return through the neutral, but go "around" it
      - which explains why i remember reading that "you dont want to ground after the inverter"
        - probably inverter has builtin GFCI

  - > For non-fixed systems the 'grounding relay' within the Multiplus can be utilized to create a dynamic neutral-earth bond/link ONLY when no external supply is connected - as a neutral-earth link will commonly already exist in the external supply, but this should be confirmed (the Multiplus 'grounding relay' should be programmed as required for the setup)

multiplus specs, related to grounding:

- multiplus bypass-inverter has a ground relay that connects neutral output to chassis, if no external AC supply is avail
  - this is what we want in the case of no external AC supply
  - is this connection the multiplus body lug?
  - what does it do when external AC supply _is_ avail?
    - does it still bond chassis to AC supply ground? [critical]
    - will it still operate as expected, in case we are both inverting _and_ bypassing? [critical]

  - > The Victron MultiPlus does not have an ELCI; the manual states "If an external AC supply is provided, the ground relay H will open before the input safety relay closes. This ensures the correct operation of an earth leakage circuit breaker that is connected to the output." IE, the MultiPlus's ground relay is designed to allow proper operation of any external GFCI or ELCI that is connected to the AC-out.
    - so, the multiplus does _not_ have its own GFCI, it expects an external GFCI that goes to it
    - so in this case, it just needs to pass ground current to that GFCI (to trip GFCI)


So question:
- [1] should i join neutral and ground in the distribution panel? (and is it already grounded?)
- [2] should i join chassis ground to the distribution panel ground?

for #2, it seems _essential_ that ground of the appliances is joined to ground of the chassis

why use a gfci?:
- > GFCIs protect against electrical currents that are too low to trip breakers but are more than enough to cause injury
