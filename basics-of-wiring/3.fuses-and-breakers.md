# theory

purpose of fuses and breakers:
- protect wires from overheating -> causing fire
- protect equipment from breaking

why they are needed:
- wires melt if you put too much current through [see why](0.consideration.melting-wires.md)

how they work:
- a fuse breaks, and a breaker trips, if current passing through it exceeds a threshold

---

# practice


consideration:
- fuses and breakers are rated for a specific voltage! you can not use a fuse rated for 120V in a 12V circuit


### gfci

gfci breakers are an attempt to save the most valuable equipment you have - your life. [Humans can be killed by electricity](0.consideration.death-by-electrocution.md).

gfci breakers make sure that all of the current it puts out goes right back through its negative terminal. This catches cases where electricity has found a path back to ground outside of the GFCI circuit - like through someones body.
