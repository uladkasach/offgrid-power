# Voltage Drop

The voltage drop along a conductor is proportional to the length of that conductor.

Voltage drops due to conductors is wasted energy (P = I * V), therefore it is important to consider the voltage drop across a wire for an energy efficient circuit.

# theory

### ohms law

The voltage drop in a circuit is a function of the current flowing through it (i.e., how fast electrons are pushing around) and the resistance of the circuit (i.e., how much useless pushing they have to do to get from point a to point b).

V = I * R

Therefore:
- as resistance increases, the voltage drop increases
- as resistance decreases, the voltage drop decreases

### resistance of a conductor

The resistance of a cylindrical conductor to electric current is a function of the length of the conductor (i.e., how far electrons have to push) and the diameter of the cross section of the conductor (i.e., how many electrons there to push). A more thorough explanation of _why_ this occurs can be found [here](../0.fundamentals-of-electricity/resistance-of-conductors.md). This relationship is formally described by the following equation:

 > R=ρL/A = ρL/(pi*r^2)

Therefore:
- resistance increases linearly with the length of the wire
- resistance decreases exponentially with the radius of the wire


# practice

The larger the gauge of wire you have, the further it will be able to efficiently carry energy, as the resistance will be lower. See more details in [wire sizing](./1.wires.sizing.md).
