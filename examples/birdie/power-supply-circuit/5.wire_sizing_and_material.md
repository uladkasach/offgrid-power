we're going with:
- 3/0 awg for the 250amp circuits
  - this is a very safe estimate as
    - we're running a 24v system. most people use 4/0 w/ 12v (and we're putting 1/2 the amount of amps through)
    - we probably will never see more than 200 amps on those lines
    - 3/0 is rated for 300 amps w/ a 75deg insulator - we have a 105deg insulator on the wire we're using (temco welding wire), which is rated for 385
  - where its less of a safe estimate
    - 3/0 is only rated for 230 amps in an engine room
  - also, 3 is a lucky number :)

- 6 awg for the 50amp circuits
  - required because the victron charge controllers allow max 6ga
  - nice because all of the other 50 amp wires are also 6ga (e.g., the 50amp vac 6/3 stranded wire)
  - very safe because
    - rated for 70 in the engine room, single conductor, at 75 deg insulator
    -  we have 105 deg insulator (temco welding wire) which brings it up to 100 in eng room

  - exterior rated too, so ordered another 30ft for the alternator run
    - only needed 20, but its not much more expensive and gets here much faster
- 6/3 marine grade wire for the 50amp vac circuit

- 10 awg for the 30 amp solar uv rated wire
