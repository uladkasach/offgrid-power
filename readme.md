Docs in this repo are intended to explain everything that is required in order to build your own offgrid-power solution. This involves both the science and theory behind why things are done - as well as how to best do things.

Each document will either fully contain all relevant information - or reference other documents in this repo that contain that information in more detail.

The goal is to fully answer:

- "why" each decision and consideration is made
  - with the underlying physics that constrain us
  - and the pragmatic considerations that drive us
    - safety
    - economics
    - maintainability
    - convenience
- "how" to do each step
  - with the underlying physics that enable the solution

Therefore:
  - if the purpose of a decision or consideration is not clear, please ask.
  - if how to do something is not clear, please ask.
