As we learned earlier [in the cell balancing discussion](./4.cell_ballancing.md), a good battery pack monitors individual cell voltage. This is done by the BMS.

For example, the origin jr 2 bms:
> The Orion Jr. 2 BMS unit monitors the voltage of each individual cell (through the cell tap wires) to ensure cell voltages remain within a specified range.
