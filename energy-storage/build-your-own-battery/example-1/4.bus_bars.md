# Bus Bars

Busbars are conductors that connect the cells of your battery together.

# theory

Busbars must be rated both for safety and efficiency at the current your battery circuit will need to be rated for

# practice

> thickness x width gives you the capability in AMPS. the rule is 1mm2 for 1.2A in copper or 0.75A for aluminium.
> so a busbar that is 2mm thick by 20mm wide is 40mm2 so 48A in copper.
> Busbar for battery are usually very short, so you do not need to strictly follow it.

> I would not stack several thin busbar since the contact is also important.

Note: if you have parallel connections in your battery, the current through each branch will be smaller (e.g., for two branches, half).
