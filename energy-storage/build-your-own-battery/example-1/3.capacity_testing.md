trust but verify!

after purchasing and getting the batteries, its time to capacity test them.

we purchased this unit to capacity test them:
  - MakerHawk Electronic Load Tester USB Load Tester 150W 200V 20A Resistor Adjustable Constant Current Battery Capacity Tester Module Intelligent Discharge Resistance Power Tester
    - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07F3NHHST/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
    - $49.99

tip:
- make sure the cables you use to capacity test are rated for the amps your putting through them!
- the closer the amps are to the limit of the wire, the more drop in voltage you will experience due to resistance of the wire
  - you can tell because the unit will show a significantly lower voltage than if you check the batter terminals that it is connected to

our batteries were confirmed to successfully store 190ah+ capacity
