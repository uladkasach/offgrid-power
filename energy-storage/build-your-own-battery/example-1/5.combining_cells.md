# combining cells

now that your cells are all balanced, its time to put them in their final configuration.

# considerations

### connecting to terminals
your cells should come with a way to connect to their terminals. make sure you do not over torque the connection, as you will destroy the cell in doing so.

### bus bars
make sure that the busbars you are using to connect the batteries will be able to carry the current required sufficiently
- parallel connections will divide the current going through each branch
- series connections will require the full current go through the connection

### relative motion
- make sure that the cells will not experience any relative movement - as this will cause wear on the cells over time.
- a good solution is to use something like VHB tape to join them together. further, the container that houses your cells will also support this.
