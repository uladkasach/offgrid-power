this directory details the battery we built for our van, which required an off grid storage solution that can power full time living from a van.

we built our battery ourselfs, because of the price difference and size difference between this route and prebuilt batteries.

summary:
- capacity
  - ~10 kWh
  - 24v x 380 Ah
  - 190 A => 0.5C => more than sufficient for our load
- size
- weight
- cost
