we went with:

- LiFePo4; https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33035453389.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.49924c4d9HK2kF (4PCS NEW 3.2V 190Ah Lifepo4 )
  - shell material: aluminum

  - nominal voltage: 3.2V
  - rated capacity: 190Ah (maximum capacity 195Ah)
  - internal impedance: 0.1-0.3mΩ

  - dimensions: 174mm x 54mm x 207mm => 6.85in x 2.13in x 8.15in
  - weight: 4.1kg => 9.24lbs

  - price: 4 for $720.80 => $180.2 per cell
    - => $0.29/Wh

  - cycle life (80%DOD): 4000 cycles
  - discharge:
    - max continuous discharge current: 190A (1C)
    - end-of-discharge voltage: 2.5V
    - max pulse discharge current: 528A
    - discharging temperature: -30 - 60 °C
  - charge:
    - max continuous charge current: 95A (0.5C)
    - end-of-charge voltage: 3.65V
    - charging temperature: -5 - 60 °C

We purchased 60 of them
- 16 * 190ah -> 3.2v * 190ah * 16 = 9728 Wh capacity battery

Our plan is to build the battery in a 8p2s configuration, with BMS
- 24v, 380 Ah capacity
