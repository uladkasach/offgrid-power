before connecting your cells in series, it is important to balance the cells, to get maximum capacity

otherwise, cells will empty or charge faster than others - resulting in your BMS shutting off the circuit before total capacity is reached.

# plan

based on the learnings documented in [battery-cell-balancing](../battery-cell-balancing.md), the plan is:
1. make the cells all safe to connect in parallel
   1. get them within 0.01V of eachother
2. connect them all in parallel
3. bottom balance all of the cells
   1. bottom, since this is a huge battery pack and we're closer to bottom knee than top knee - and can discharge faster than charge


# reality

1. make all cells safe to connect in parallel
  - found that all of the cells we got were all pretty much 3.3V
    - which is not surprising because from 30% S.O.C to 70% S.O.C. the cells are at 3.3V.
    - also not surprising, since best storage S.O.C is 30%
  - the two that were charged for capacity testing just need to be discharged
    - using the load tester to discharge them back to 30%
2. connect them all in parallel
  - we were lucky to get busbars for each of them
  - this part is simple, as long as the first part was done
3. bottom balance all the cells
   1. after all connected, we need to discharge them to ~3.15V (~15% S.O.C.)
      1. that is a lot of amp hours to discharge
         1. from best case scenario, at batteries being at 30% S.O.C, that is a 15% -> 3040 * 0.15 = 458 Ah to discharge
         2. from worst case scenario, at batteries being at 70% S.O.C, that is a 55% -> 3040 * 0.55 = 1672 Ah to discharge
         3. from average case scenario, at batteries being at 50% S.O.C, that is 35% -> 3040 * 0.35 = 1064 Ah to discharge
      2. that will take a decent amount of time
         1. at 15 amps, that will take
            1. 458 Ah / 15 A = 30.5 hours (~1.5 days)
            2. 1672 Ah / 15 A = 111 hours (~5 days)
            3. 1064 Ah / 15 A = 71 hours (~3 days)
         2. at 30 amps, that will take
            1. 15 hours
            2. 50 hours
            3. 35 hours
   2. main concern is overdischarging
      1. could build a raspberry pi that controls a relay:

      2. wonder if relay can just be controlled by source voltage though - then no need for pi
      3. to be honest though, can just keep an eye on it. the load tester has a low voltage shutoff
