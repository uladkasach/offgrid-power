before connecting your cells in series, it is important to balance the cells

unlike lead-acid batteries [source], lifepo4 batteries do _not_ balance themselves when connected in series [source]; therefore, the batteries must be balanced actively.

the plan we went with is:
- roughly balance the 2p cells
  - just close enough only to ensure no over-current
  - parall
  - the paired-cells will self-balance within the pair, due to contact over infinite time
- bottom balance the 8s cells
  - they must be balanced close enough so that the BMS's low current balancing can take over the final balancing
  - bottom balance instead of top balance because it is faster to achieve, primarily
  - bottom -vs- top is not that big of a difference in our case, because the BMS will monitor each cell and make sure none of them go into dangerous territory
