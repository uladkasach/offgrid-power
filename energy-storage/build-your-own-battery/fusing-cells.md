  - > Back to the original post I think it is only worth fusing small cells. The reason being the amount of heat generated by different sized cells when they are short circuited.
  - > The total amount of electrical energy stored in an 18650 LCO cell is ~12Wh (3.6Vx3.4Ah). If we say a sustained short circuit current of 10C which gives a 'burn time' of ~6 minutes we get the power dissipated in the cell at ~120W. It is quite possible that a well designed battery pack with well designed thermal management could cope with this, there is an interesting NASA technical paper on this.
  -> On the other hand if we have a 100Ah LFP cell which is storing around ~325Wh of energy with the same burn time of ~6 minutes we have to dissipate ~3.25kW without raising the temperature of the cell to the point where it catches fire!
  -> Because of this and because it is so easy I would say it is worth fusing individual 18650 cells but not large prismatics.
