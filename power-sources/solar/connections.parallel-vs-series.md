For a small system, it is much better to wire in series than parallel, due to:
- pros:
  - reduced parts + increased simplicity
  - most charge controllers having problems at lower voltage + higher current
- cons:
  - if partially covered or damaged panel, total output will be limited (but this can be solved by you easily)

  - > Parking location and equipment maintenance are two things you have control over.  Air temperature, clouds, and how long the sun is in the sky are things you have no control over.  Pick your battles.

considerations:
- when wiring in series, amps remains low, voltage gets high
- when wiring in parallel, amps gets high, voltage remains low

remaining questions:
- why does charge controller not do well with low voltage? [non-blocking]
